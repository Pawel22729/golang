                <b><u>$ Who I am?</u></b>
                <br>
                From my experience and school faculty - I am a System Engineer. More recently called Devops and Cloud System Engineer.
                <br>
                <b><u>$ What do I do?</u></b>
                <br>
                If you are reading this, I can bet that you already know the most of the duties of the guy like me.
                The role of System Engineer this days is evolving quite rapidly. Probably that is why the titles are being changed so often.
